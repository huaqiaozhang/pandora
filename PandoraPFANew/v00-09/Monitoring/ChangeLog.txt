Added Pause and Create APIs, allowing for easy creation of Monitoring TApplication and allowing access to reusable pause functionality.

TAG V00-06 FOR ILCSOFT USAGE
************************************************************************
Moved PandoraMonitoring to PandoraPFANew repository.
Updated to reflect recent changes to pandora APIs, including typedef changes and use of CaloHitLists, rather than OrderedCaloHitLists.
Added ability to deal with pandora rectangular and pointing calo hits, via virtual function CaloHit::GetCellCorners.
Added hit colour scheme that uses continuous palette to reflect energy of hits.
Removed unused options to draw fit to clusters and pfos.

************************************************************************
TAG V00-05 FOR ILCSOFT USAGE
************************************************************************
Added ability to draw pandora histograms.
Added option for drawing each cluster/pfo with a different color (iterates through list of available colors).
Updated to reflect changes to pandora::CartesianVector class.
Addressed issues raised by Coverity.
Removed dashes from TEveList names in tree menu of the TEve display for PFOs and for tracks
Muon endcap is invisible by default only if muon barrel exists; helps with visualization of test beam set ups.
Updated standalone Makefile: changed default compiler to g++ and added -O2 optimization flag.

************************************************************************
TAG V00-04 FOR ILCSOFT USAGE
************************************************************************
Updated CMake files to use new ILCUTIL package.
Updated CMake files to reflect restructuring of PandoraPFANew.
Updated standalone makefile to reflect restructuring of PandoraPFANew.
Added checks on initialization of subdetector parameters before attempting to draw.
Added ability to draw inner detector, if details have been provided.
Changed all references to "track state at ecal" to "track state at calorimeter".
Made use of IsMirroredInZ subdetector functionality.
Updated to reflect changes to GeometryHelper.
Improved exception handling when creating TEveManager.
Improved memory management when sorting content by energy, etc.
Addressed CppCheck (static analysis package) warnings.

************************************************************************
TAG V00-03 FOR ILCSOFT USAGE
************************************************************************
Display maximum and minimum radiation and interaction lengths from the ip for all calo hit lists.
Reduced geometry dependence, adding try/catch blocks around queries for any specific geometry information.

************************************************************************
CREATE CLIC_CDR BRANCH
************************************************************************
Added transparency for calorimeter hits (option)
Added color scheme AUTOTYPE, which highlights confusion between neutral hadrons, charged hadrons, electrons, muons or photons.
Added color-scheme AUTOID, which highlights particle ID issues.
Updated calls to GetBField function, which now take a position vector as an argument.
Sort lists of MCParticles, Tracks, Clusters and Pfos by energy.
Added ability to set the TEve display background color (black or white) and to choose whether to draw detector elements.
Changed default background color to white
Improved tool-tip information (add MC particle info for calohitclusters)
Provided a gnu makefile.

************************************************************************
TAG V00-02 FOR ILCSOFT USAGE
************************************************************************
Added axis title parameters for histograms.
Added functionality to add, multiply or divide histograms.
Updated to reflect changes to pandora GeometryHelper.
Set BUILD_32BIT_COMPATIBLE to OFF by default.

************************************************************************
LCD_WG2_VALIDATION_3 TAG
************************************************************************
Flip sign of magnetic field, rather than individual track charges, in order to match ALICE sign convention.
Cluster fit arrow now turned off by default.
Added visualization of MCParticles.
Only draw MC particles up to their specified "EndPoint"
Added suppression of MC particles, with given PDG codes, below specified energy thresholds.
Added output showing the division of energy between MC particles for a calo hit list.
Added visualization of specified detector gaps.
Added muon system to the visualized detector geometry (by default invisible)
Added calo hit title information (interaction lengths, pseudolayers)
Draw charged PFOs even if they contain no associated clusters.

************************************************************************
LCD_WG2_VALIDATION_2 TAG
************************************************************************
Add checks for incorrect calo hit normal vectors
Tidied entire package, aggressively removing outdated features and support for old root versions (pre ~5.25.00).
Removed lcio dependency.
